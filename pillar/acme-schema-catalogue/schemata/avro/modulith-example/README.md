# Modulith Example Avro Schemata

A catalogue of Avro schemata that are used by the Modulith Example service.

The reason why these are here and not within the service itself is to highlight that these should be shared company-wide within Acme. This folder would normally be a Git Submodule pointing at another repository. This way, other repositories could reference the same Avro schemata, and map them to models that use other programming languages.
